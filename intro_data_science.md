Data Science:

When we talk about data science, the first thing we want to know is: "What is data science?"
Different person(organization) has a different definition and understanding:

Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.    -- Wikipedia

Data science provides meaningful information based on large amounts of complex data or big data. Data science, or data-driven science, combines different fields of work in statistics and computation to interpret data for decision-making purposes.      --Investopedia

Whatever how they define it, the core information is exactly the same. In my personal aspect, I can not find any sentence that perfectly explains it.

Processing of Data science:
illustrating the process:

1. Pitching ideas for data science projects to investors/managers.
2. Collecting data
3. Monitoring
4. Integration
5. Interpretation: e.g. the Linked Open Data (LOD) graph can sometimes be used to ascribe meaning (semantics) to data.
6. Governance: caring for the data and its subjects./ managing data standards and formats.
7. Engineering
8. Wrangling: Inspecting and cleaning the data.
9. Modelling: Proposing a conceptual / mathematical/ functional model.
10. Visualisation: Visualising data to interpret it and present results.
11. Operationalization: putting the results to work.


The standard value chain:

Collection: getting the data

Engineering: storage and computational resources across full lifecycle

Governance: overall management of data across full lifecycle

Wrangling: data preprocessing, cleaning

Analysis: discovery (learning, etc.)

Presentation: arguing the case that the results are significant and useful

Operationalization: putting the results to work, so as to gain benefits or value



The whole process may change for a different task, but the core idea is the same.
